# Database Schema & Delta-Sync Rules

This rule document governs all database implementations (Android Room, Desktop SQLite, and Server SQLite) and delta-synchronization protocols.

All AI agents and contributors must follow these rules.

## 1. Schema Entity Parity (1:1 Core Mapping)

Core tables share identical column names and types across Server, Mobile, and Desktop:

* **`users`:** `id` (UUID PK), `lrn_or_id` (Unique), `full_name`, `role` (`'TEACHER'` | `'STUDENT'`), `pin_hash`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
* **`classrooms`:** `id` (UUID PK), `name`, `section`, `class_code` (Unique 6-char), `teacher_id` (FK), `created_at`, `updated_at`.
* **`enrollments`:** `id` (UUID PK), `classroom_id` (FK), `student_id` (FK), `status` (`'PENDING'` | `'ACTIVE'` | `'REJECTED'`), `joined_at`, `updated_at`.
* **`announcements`:** `id` (UUID PK), `classroom_id` (FK), `title`, `content`, `allow_comments`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
* **`announcement_comments`:** `id` (UUID PK), `announcement_id` (FK), `author_id` (FK), `content`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
* **`materials`:** `id` (UUID PK), `classroom_id` (FK), `title`, `file_type` (`'DOCUMENT'` | `'VIDEO'` | `'WORKSHEET'`), `file_path`, `file_size_bytes`, `extracted_text`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
* **`assignments`:** `id` (UUID PK), `classroom_id` (FK), `title`, `instructions`, `deped_category` (`'WRITTEN_WORK'` | `'PERFORMANCE_TASK'` | `'QUARTERLY_ASSESSMENT'`), `due_date`, `max_points`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
* **`assignment_submissions`:** `id` (UUID PK), `assignment_id` (FK), `student_id` (FK), `file_path`, `file_type`, `submitted_at`, `score`, `teacher_feedback`, `updated_at`.
* **`quizzes`:** `id` (UUID PK), `classroom_id` (FK), `title`, `instructions`, `deped_category` (`'WRITTEN_WORK'` | `'PERFORMANCE_TASK'` | `'QUARTERLY_ASSESSMENT'`), `time_limit_minutes`, `status` (`'DRAFT'` | `'ACTIVE'` | `'CLOSED'`), `started_at` (Epoch ms), `created_at`, `updated_at`.
* **`quiz_questions`:** `id` (UUID PK), `quiz_id` (FK), `order_index`, `question_text`, `question_type`, `options_json`, `points`, `image_path`, `created_at`, `updated_at`. (Server adds `correct_answer`).
* **`quiz_attempts`:** `id` (UUID PK), `quiz_id` (FK), `student_id` (FK), `started_at`, `submitted_at`, `score`, `total_points`, `answers_json`, `updated_at`.
* **`ai_chat_messages`:** `id` (UUID PK), `classroom_id` (FK), `student_id` (FK), `material_id` (FK), `role` (`'USER'` | `'TUTOR'`), `content`, `created_at`.

## 2. Client-Specific Columns (Mobile & Desktop Only)

Client databases store an offline slice and must include these helper columns:

1. **`sync_status` (TEXT):**
   * Added to `assignment_submissions` and `quiz_attempts`.
   * Values: `'SYNCED'` (confirmed by server) or `'QUEUED_FOR_SYNC'` (created offline at home, pending upload upon Wi-Fi reconnect).
2. **`local_file_path` (TEXT, Nullable):**
   * Added to `materials`.
   * Stores the absolute on-disk path of the cached PDF or MP4 file (e.g., `/data/user/0/org.lara.student/files/lesson3.mp4`).

---

## 3. Strict Anti-Cheat: Stripping `correct_answer`

* **Server:** `quiz_questions` contains `correct_answer` used by the server auto-grader.
* **Client Security Rule:** When the server sends quiz questions to student clients (`GET /api/quizzes/:id` or WebSocket broadcast), **it must strictly strip the `correct_answer` field**.
* **Invariant:** Never transmit answer keys to student client databases during an active quiz. Doing so allows students to extract answers by reading their phone's local SQLite file.

---

## 4. Delta-Sync Handshake & Master Ledger

1. **Server Ledger (`sync_revisions`):**
   * The Hub maintains a monotonic record of changes: `(id, classroom_id, entity_table, entity_id, action, updated_at)`.
   * `classroom_id` scopes the changes to specific classes (or `NULL` for global/profile updates), ensuring delete events and resource changes can be filtered per student without scanning deleted rows.
   * `action` is `'UPSERT'` or `'DELETE'`. This allows clients to reliably purge deleted announcements and materials.
2. **Pull Phase (`POST /api/sync/pull`):**
   * Client transmits `{ student_id, last_synced_at }`.
   * Server returns all records where `updated_at > last_synced_at` for the student's enrolled classes.
   * Client must write all deltas inside a single atomic SQLite transaction (`@Transaction` in Room, `BEGIN TRANSACTION` in SQLite).
3. **Push Phase (`POST /api/sync/push`):**
   * Client uploads queued records (`QUEUED_FOR_SYNC`).
   * Server validates, processes grades, commits to master DB, and returns confirmation receipts (`ack: true`).
   * Client marks local rows as `'SYNCED'`.

## 5. Technology Stack Invariants
* **Android:** Must use **Android Room (SQLite)**.
* **Server:** Must use **SQLx (Rust)** or **Drizzle + `better-sqlite3` (Node)**.
* **Desktop:** Must use **`@tauri-apps/plugin-sql`**.
* **Forbidden:** Never use Prisma.

## 6. Offline-First Default Access (Home Study Mode)

The client applications (Android Room and Desktop SQLite) are strictly **offline-first by default**:

* **Zero Network Blocking Screens:** When launched without Wi-Fi or when disconnected from the Dedicated Server (e.g. at home), the app must NEVER present a blocking "No Connection" error dialog.
* **Full Local Read Access:** Students must always be able to browse their enrolled classrooms, read announcements, study pre-extracted lesson text chunks, view cached PDFs, and play downloaded video lessons completely offline.
* **Offline Homework Capture:** Pupils can take homework photos via CameraX or write responses while offline at home; these are stored locally with status `'QUEUED_FOR_SYNC'`.
* **Graceful AI Layering:**
  * **Capable Devices (RAM ≥ 6GB on mobile, or laptop with ≥ 4GB RAM) with model installed:** Socratic AI tutoring is **100% accessible offline at home**.
  * **Low-RAM Devices (< 6GB) or model not installed:** All classroom materials, handouts, and announcements remain 100% accessible, while the AI chat sheet displays: *"L.A.R.A AI is available when connected to the classroom Hub."*
