# L.A.R.A — Agent Development Rules & Architectural Guidelines

This document outlines the mandatory architectural invariants, technical constraints, coding standards, and pedagogical guardrails for developing the **L.A.R.A** (Localized Augmented Resource & Assessment) offline classroom platform.

All AI agents and human contributors must adhere strictly to these rules.

## 0. Team Organization & Three Project Streams

The engineering team is strictly structured into three decoupled project streams, overseen by the Lead Developer:

1. **Mobile Project Team (`mobile/`):**
   * **Scope:** Native Android Client (Kotlin 2.x + Jetpack Compose + Material 3).
   * **Responsibilities:** Room SQLite offline caching, CameraX homework photo capture, Jetpack Media3 video playback, and JNI llama.cpp ARM64 bindings for capable devices.
   * **Target Hardware:** 3GB/4GB RAM budget phones (Infinix, TECNO, itel, realme). Strict memory ceiling: heap < 250MB.

2. **Desktop Project Team (`desktop/`):**
   * **Scope:** Cross-Platform Desktop Client (Tauri 2.x + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS).
   * **Responsibilities:** School computer lab (DepEd PC packages) & student laptop client, local SQLite via Tauri plugin, bundled llama.cpp sidecar execution on laptops with >= 4GB RAM.

3. **Server Project Team (`server/`):**
   * **Scope:** Local Hub Server & Teacher Host Application (Tauri + Rust/Node backend engine).
   * **Responsibilities:** mDNS responder (`_lara._tcp.local`), UDP subnet broadcast beacon (`:8888`), central SQLite database, captive download portal (`:8080/download`), HTTP 206 video streaming, WebSocket real-time event broker, and llama-server multi-slot FIFO queue.

4. **Lead Developer (Tech Lead & Gatekeeper):**
   * Oversees all three projects.
   * Reviews all pull requests using the `lead-companion` protocol.
   * Gatekeeps merges into `staging` and releases to `main`.
   * Enforces the zero-internet policy, budget hardware memory limits, and Socratic pedagogical rules.

### Modular Architecture & Rule Documents
Every contributor and AI agent must consult the dedicated rule files in `rules/` for their specific domain:
* **Developer Tooling & Testing:** [`rules/developer-tooling-and-testing.md`](./rules/developer-tooling-and-testing.md)
* **Database & Delta-Sync:** [`rules/database-and-sync.md`](./rules/database-and-sync.md)
* **Quiz Engine & Anti-Cheat:** [`rules/quiz-and-anti-cheat.md`](./rules/quiz-and-anti-cheat.md)
* **LAN Networking & Protocols:** [`rules/networking-and-lan.md`](./rules/networking-and-lan.md)
* **Socratic AI & SLM Guardrails:** [`rules/socratic-ai-guardrails.md`](./rules/socratic-ai-guardrails.md)
* **UI/UX & Elementary Accessibility:** [`rules/ui-and-accessibility.md`](./rules/ui-and-accessibility.md)
* **Team Workflow & PR Criteria:** [`rules/team-workflow-and-prs.md`](./rules/team-workflow-and-prs.md)

## 1. Non-Negotiable System Invariants

### 1.1 Zero Internet Dependency (LAN Only)
* The entire system must function 100% locally across an isolated Wi-Fi router or peer hotspot with no uplink to the global internet.
* **Never introduce external cloud dependencies:** Do not add Firebase, Google Play Services, external CDNs, web fonts from Google Fonts, remote analytics, or remote API keys.
* All assets, fonts, icons, installers, model weights, and media must be bundled locally or served via the Local Hub.

### 1.2 Offline-First Persistence
* Both client applications (Android and Desktop) must store an offline mirror of all enrolled subjects, announcements, downloaded handouts, video lessons, and quiz histories in local SQLite.
* Students must be able to launch the app at home in a disconnected state and review materials or interact with the local AI tutor without errors or blocking loaders.
* Disconnected network operations (submitting finished quizzes, camera homework photos) must be saved locally with state `QUEUED_FOR_SYNC` and automatically flush to the Hub upon reconnecting to the classroom Wi-Fi.

### 1.3 Strict Network Protocol & Port Allocations
* **HTTP REST Server (Port 8080):** 
  * Captive distribution portal at `http://<hub-ip>:8080/download`.
  * Binary file transfers (APKs, desktop installers, PDFs, GGUF model files).
  * Video streaming strictly using HTTP Byte-Range requests (`Range: bytes=X-`, response `206 Partial Content`).
  * Per-client streaming rate limit (max 2.0 MB/s) to prevent classroom Wi-Fi router congestion.
* **Realtime Event Broker (Port 8081):**
  * WebSockets exclusively for low-latency events: live quiz timers, active student presence, enrollment approvals, announcements push, and Hub-assisted AI token streaming.
* **Discovery Service:**
  * mDNS service identifier: `_lara._tcp.local` on port 8080.
  * UDP subnet broadcast beacon: Broadcast JSON packet every 3 seconds to `255.255.255.255:8888`.
  * Manual IP entry fallback must always remain accessible on the connection screen.

## 2. Pluggable Socratic AI Tutor & Model Benchmarking (GGUF / llama.cpp)

The AI tutor (**L.A.R.A AI**) is a pedagogical guide for Filipino elementary pupils (Grades 1 to 6). The inference architecture is **pluggable and model-agnostic**, executing quantized GGUF models via `llama.cpp` (JNI on Android, sidecar on Desktop, `llama-server` on Local Hub).

While **MiniCPM5-2B (Int4)** serves as our primary baseline candidate, the system is designed to experimentally benchmark other candidate edge SLMs (e.g. **Qwen2.5-1.5B/3B**, **Llama-3.2-1B/3B**, **Gemma-2-2B**, **SmolLM2-1.7B**) to find the optimal combination of Filipino/English comprehension, Socratic reasoning, and memory efficiency.

### 2.1 Hardware-Adaptive Dual Routing
* **Android Phones with < 6GB physical RAM:** Must strictly route inference to the Local Hub over WebSockets (port 8081). Client heap must stay < 250MB to prevent Android Low Memory Killer (LMK/OOM) crashes on 3GB/4GB budget devices (Infinix, TECNO, itel, realme).
* **Phones with ≥ 6GB RAM & Student Laptops:** Can execute supported candidate GGUF models 100% locally via `llama.cpp` (JNI on Android, sidecar binary on Desktop).
* **Hub Queue:** The Local Hub manages concurrent low-RAM requests using a FIFO queue with 2 to 4 parallel `llama-server` slots, pushing queue status (`"Pangalawa ka sa pila - est. 4s"`) over WebSockets.

### 2.2 Socratic Prompt Directives
1. **Never output direct answers:** If asked "What is the answer to #3?" or "Ano ang sagot sa tanong na ito?", the tutor must decline warmly:
   *"Hindi ko maibibigay ang mismong sagot, pero tutulungan kitang tuklasin ito! Balikan natin ang binasa mo. Ano ang unang hakbang?"*
2. **Strict Grounding:** Base all hints and questions strictly on the teacher's uploaded lesson module text chunks. Do not extrapolate beyond provided material.
3. **Step-by-Step Questioning:** Give only one small clue at a time, followed by a leading question that prompts the child to take the next reasoning step.
4. **Bilingual Agility:** Understand and respond in the pupil's chosen language (English or natural conversational Filipino/Taglish).
5. **Assessment Integrity (Hard Quiz Lockout):**
   * While a paperless quiz is active, the AI tutor button is completely removed from the UI.
   * The Hub backend must reject any inference requests originating from a student with an active quiz session (`HTTP 403 / QUIZ_IN_PROGRESS`).

## 3. UI/UX Guidelines (Elementary School Accessibility)

* **Design Authority:** [`docs/design-system.md`](./docs/design-system.md) and the tokens in `design-system/` are canonical for all three apps. Developers are free to design screen layouts as long as they use only the documented tokens, components and rules, and follow Google Classroom as the structural reference (see the Google Classroom reference section in the design system doc).
* **Components:** Android uses `androidx.compose.material3` components themed with `design-system/mobile/*`. Desktop uses Tailwind with `design-system/desktop/tailwind.theme.ts`. Icons are Phosphor and the font is Nunito, both bundled in `design-system/assets/`.
* **Target Audience:** Filipino elementary pupils (Grades 1 to 6) and public school teachers (DepEd).
* **Touch Targets:** Minimum 52dp (preferred 56dp) on mobile for young learners' touch accuracy.

* **Visual Hierarchy:** Large, high-contrast typography, clear iconography accompanied by text labels, and clean cards. Avoid dense nested menus or complex technical terminology.
* **Bilingual UI:** All user-facing text must be localized into English and Filipino. Never hardcode strings in UI components.
* **Camera Capture:** CameraX integration must include document framing guides and automatic compression to JPEG (<800KB target).
* **DepEd Gradebook Export:** Hub desktop application must export consolidated class records to `.xlsx` / `.csv` formatted according to official DepEd standards with direct export to USB flash drives.

## 4. Subsystem Guidelines & Conventions

### 4.1 Mobile Client (`mobile/`)
* **Framework:** Native Android (Kotlin 2.x + Jetpack Compose + Material 3).
* **Dual Roles:** Role-based UI switching for both **Student** and **Teacher** (Teacher can approve enrollments on-the-go, launch quizzes, and view live score telemetry from their phone).
* **Architecture:** Clean Architecture + MVI/MVVM with Kotlin Coroutines and StateFlow.
* **Database:** Room DB (SQLite) with compile-time query verification.
* **Media:** Jetpack Media3 (ExoPlayer) with hardware decoding.
* **AI:** `llama.cpp` JNI C++ bindings compiled for `arm64-v8a`.
* **Verification:** Run `./gradlew test` and `./gradlew lint` before proposing changes.

### 4.2 Desktop Client (`desktop/`)
* **Framework:** Tauri 2.x + React 19 + TypeScript 5.x + Tailwind CSS 4.x.
* **Styling:** Material 3 color palettes and elevation tokens configured in Tailwind.
* **TypeScript Quality:** Strict type checking enabled (`strict: true`). Avoid `any`; use explicit interfaces matching backend schemas.
* **Database:** Local SQLite via `@tauri-apps/plugin-sql`.
* **AI:** Bundled `llama.cpp` binary invoked via Tauri sidecar process on machines with >= 4GB RAM.
* **Verification:** Run `npm run build` (`tsc && vite build`) to verify zero type errors.

### 4.3 Server Local Hub (`server/`)
* **Framework:** Tauri 2.x Desktop GUI + Rust/Node backend engine.
* **Database:** Central SQLite via SQLx / better-sqlite3 with automatic ACID migrations.
* **Concurrency:** Rust Tokio async runtime or Fastify async engine.
* **Rate Limiting:** Enforce 2 MB/s per client stream for videos to protect local Wi-Fi routers.
* **Verification:** Run `cargo check` and `cargo test` on the server backend.

### 4.4 Mandatory Folder-Level Documentation
To ensure the Lead Developer and future teammates have immediate technical context:
* **Mobile Developers:** Document architecture, Room schemas, and CameraX gotchas in `mobile/docs/` (or update `mobile/README.md`).
* **Desktop Developers:** Document components, state flows, and Tauri sidecars in `desktop/docs/` (or update `desktop/README.md`).
* **Server Developers:** Document routes, SQLite migrations, and `llama-server` queues in `server/docs/` (or update `server/README.md`).
* Every PR introducing major features must include updated documentation within its assigned folder.

## 5. Code Hygiene & Anti-Slop Standards

* **No AI-Slop Comments:** Do not write obvious comments (e.g., `// create button`, `// set state to true`). Only write comments that explain non-obvious domain logic, hardware workarounds, or pedagogical constraints.
* **Evidence Before Assertions:** When implementing features or fixing bugs, verify with build outputs, tests, or compiler logs before claiming a task is complete.
* **Graceful Failure:** Always handle network drops cleanly. Network timeouts or broken sockets must never crash client applications or corrupt local SQLite databases.
